# ATMProject
ATM Project is about where you can enter pin number,deposit , and withdraw form the specific or your preferred bank .
This Java-based ATM Project is a console application that simulates basic ATM functionalities such as balance inquiry, deposit, and withdrawal. It starts with PIN authentication (default PIN: 1234) and presents users with a menu-driven interface to perform various banking operations. The application validates user inputs, ensuring no negative transactions and sufficient balance for withdrawals. It is built using simple Java constructs like classes, methods, conditionals, loops, and the Scanner class for user input. Designed for beginners, this project helps understand fundamental programming concepts and simulates real-world banking processes in a controlled, interactive environment.
